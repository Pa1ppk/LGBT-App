# LGBT-App
A welfare app for the lgbt community
 From olden days Transgenders face severe discrimination in our society, whether it is at
 work,schools, hospitals, and local communities. They are not getting equal opportun ities
 and the freedom provided by our constitution. Most of the things related to transgender
 community, are related to social practices. Mobile phones revolutionize the societies now.
 As an example,social media is growing much faster than the main steam media. This
 happened because of the accessibility of the mo- bile phones to almost every adult of
 our nation. As citizens of this great nation, an attempt is being made to create an app
 on mobile phone to revolutionize and break the social stigma related to acceptance of
 transgender community. The proposed app is provided with all the statutory, legal and
 constitutional rights provided to transgenders by the governments. The app also contains
 a home page providing motivational stories, social events, job opportunities, educational
 opportunities, scholarships, charities etc. The app also provides a personalized informa
tion by providing a user account. App also provide a forum to discuss social issues, to
 post questions, to answer questions, to post opportunities, to provide suggestions etc.
 App also provide a blog page where interested and able transgenders to post the suc
cess stories, to provide a path to fellow transgenders, to provide solutions for different
 discriminations etc. Technically the app contains a database to store the content and
 personalized information, a server to provide stored content.
